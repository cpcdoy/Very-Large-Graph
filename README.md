# Very-Large-Graph

## Description

Applying the Louvain algorithm on Watt's Caveman graphs and computing timings and more.

A Jupyter python notebook was done in order to permit visualization of the computed data.

## Usage

```sh
sh run.sh
jupyter notebook
```

or if you just want to build the Caveman generator:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

And to clean everything:
```sh
make deep_clean      # A better make clean ;)
```

## Report

A report, describing the results of the research, is present at the root of the project's directory.

It, unfortunately, had to be written in french.
